# Satisfy llm-d-benchmark's "is prometheus-adapter installed?" probe without
# taking over a ClusterRole that belongs to somebody else.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# prometheus-adapter and KEDA both register the external.metrics.k8s.io
# APIService, and a cluster has exactly one. We run KEDA, so standup must skip
# the prometheus-adapter install -- but its probe checks for the ClusterRole
# `prometheus-adapter-resource-reader` and refuses to continue without it. The
# cheap answer is to create a stub carrying the Helm ownership metadata the
# probe looks for.
#
# The trap is that the object is CLUSTER-scoped. `kubectl annotate --overwrite`
# on a shared cluster does not create our own copy, it rewrites whoever else's:
# point `meta.helm.sh/release-namespace` at our namespace and the real release's
# next `helm upgrade` fails on invalid ownership metadata. On a ~12-tenant
# cluster that is somebody's outage, caused by a benchmark.
#
# So: create it only when it is genuinely absent, and say plainly which case we
# are in otherwise. The probe passes on any existing object regardless of who
# owns it, so declining costs nothing.
#
# Usage:
#   pa_clusterrole.sh stub <monitoring-namespace>
#
# Exit status is 0 for every outcome except a real failure to create; "declined"
# is a success, not an error.
