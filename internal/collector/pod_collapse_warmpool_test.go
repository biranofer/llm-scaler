// A DP>1 BRIDGE collapses to one replica, and stays a bridge.
//
// A warm pool Pod lent to a variant is one scale-target replica exactly like an
// ordinary Pod, so its data-parallel ranks merge the same way. The two Pod-level
// facts have to survive that merge: FromWarmPool decides whether the row counts
// as the variant's own SUPPLY, and Ready decides whether it counts as SERVING.
// Losing either on a DP variant would apply the bridge rules to some variants
// and not others, for no reason an operator could see.

// TWO MODELS IN ONE POD ARE NOT DATA PARALLELISM.
//
// This is the case a warm pool creates and an ordinary fleet cannot. An ordinary
// Pod belongs to exactly one variant, so keying the merge by Pod name is safe.
// A POOL Pod holds several models at once -- that is what a warm set is -- each
// on its own port, and the collector keys instances "pod:port" so each appears
// as a separate row for the same Pod.
//
// Merging those sums the capacity of models that have nothing to do with each
// other into whichever row happened to come first. On a lent Pod every row
// carries the variant it is lent to, so the sleepers' KV cache would be added to
// the awake model's supply -- the variant would be told it has more capacity
// than the engine serving it actually has, which is the one direction that
// causes a scale-DOWN it cannot serve.
//
// Data parallelism is ranks of the SAME model, so the model is what separates
// the two cases.
