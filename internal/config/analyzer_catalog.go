// ExternalAnalyzerBody is one inference engine's query and per-replica target in
// a catalog definition. The field names mirror KEDA's Prometheus scaler
// (threshold is a string, e.g. "0.5").
//
// query must resolve to the model's TOTAL demand (every series it returns is
// summed) and threshold is what ONE scale-target replica — a pod, or an LWS
// group — can serve, not one engine instance. A sum-shaped query is safe at any
// granularity; count() and avg() are not, since they measure in DP ranks. See
// external.Body for the full note.

// scaling-policy surface leaves one place to look for "how is scaling configured",
// and puts definitions in the same object as the tiers that select them — related
// settings that were previously two ConfigMaps apart, with nothing tying a
// policy's analyzer name to the definition it resolves against.
//
// Cluster-scoped, like limiters: read from the SYSTEM namespace's ConfigMap only.
// A workload namespace declaring analyzers is reported and ignored — see
// parseSaturationConfig. Note this still lets a per-namespace WVA install define
// its own, since that install's own namespace IS its system namespace.
