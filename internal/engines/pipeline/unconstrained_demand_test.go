// which pool, which nothing can answer until the scheduler has chosen.
//
// The two wrong answers are both reachable and both were live at some point: an
// inference.optimization/acceleratorName label named a pool the scheduler was
// free to contradict (removed), and denying outright refused a workload that
// several accelerators could have served.
