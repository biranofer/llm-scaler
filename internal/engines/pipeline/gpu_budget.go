// FitsGPUBudget reports whether allocating demand — GPUs keyed by accelerator
// type — is permitted in namespace under the given constraints.
//
// It answers the question the scale-from-zero engine has to ask before waking a
// variant: would this actually get GPUs, or would its pods sit Pending while the
// request that asked for it times out anyway. Waking something that cannot be
// placed is worse than not waking it, because it looks like progress.
//
// The budget semantics are the optimizer's, reused rather than restated so the
// two cannot drift:
//
//   - Per-type budgets are the minimum available across providers, with the
//     Limit < 0 sentinel meaning unlimited (see mergeConstraints).
//   - A namespace that appears in any provider's NamespacePools is a CLOSED
//     allowlist: an accelerator type it does not list is denied outright, and a
//     listed type is capped at the tighter of its cluster and namespace budgets
//     (see mergeNamespaceConstraints).
//   - An accelerator type no provider knows about is denied, matching the
//     optimizer's treatment of absent constraints as zero capacity rather than
//     unlimited.
//
// No constraints at all means "unknown", which returns true. That mirrors the
// engine's own fallback when no provider can supply constraints: proceed rather
// than block scaling silently. Denying instead would keep a model down for the
// first cycle after every restart — exactly when a queued request is waiting on
// it.
