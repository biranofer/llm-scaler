// several models on one set of GPUs with only one awake, and choosing which
// means comparing how hard each is being pushed -- a comparison the pool cannot
// make, because it sees Pods and not load. The optimizer already computes both
// numbers per variant on every pass; this carries them to the component that has
// to choose between variants.

	//

	// with a hundred thousand and another on a variant with eleven.
