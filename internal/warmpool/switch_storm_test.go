// A STANDING intent is not a new switch on every pass.
//
// A switch is decided from what is AWAKE, and the intent only lands once the
// chosen model is actually serving. Until then `awake` still reads empty, so the
// same candidate wins again on the very next pass -- and nothing brakes it,
// because a candidate that needs to scale up preempts MinInterval by design.
// That preemption is argued from there being an awake model to trade away, which
// in this case there is not.
//
// Measured on pokprod 2026-08-30: 263 identical intents in about four minutes,
// all `from ""` to the same variant. The noise was the least of it. The clock
// was re-stamped every pass, so MinInterval never elapsed -- a later switch on
// spare capacity could be deferred indefinitely by an intent that had not
// landed.
//
// The intent must still be RETURNED, though: a model that has not woken is
// exactly what the next pass should go on trying to wake. Only the announcement
// and the clock are suppressed.
