// A borrow that RECORDS ITSELF must still expire.
//
// Every other hold-timeout test seeds r.borrowedAt by hand and then asserts the
// return, which proves the policy and the plumbing below it. What none of them
// covers is the key: recordBorrow writes under the variant of the ACTION, and
// the timeout looks up under the variant of the MEMBERSHIP read back on the
// next pass. If those two ever disagree the lookup misses, borrowedAt falls
// back to Now, the age is recomputed as zero on every pass, and the hold
// timeout can never fire.
//
// That failure is silent by construction. `lent` in the state line is counted
// from memberships (lentPods), not from borrowedAt, so a pool with a missing
// borrow record still reports lent=1 and looks entirely healthy -- it just
// never hands the Pod back, which is the one thing the timeout exists to do.
//
// So this drives a real borrow, lets it record itself, reads the Pod back the
// way a cluster would, advances past MaxHold, and asks for the return.
