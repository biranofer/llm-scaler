// by MinGap at 250ms. A busy trigger therefore drives about four a second.
// Measured on pokprod: 3.2/s, 8527 identical lines in 45 minutes, which buried
// the switch and lend lines they were supposed to sit alongside.

// The line's own comment claimed "every five seconds", which is where the
// mistake came from -- so this pins the behaviour rather than the comment.
