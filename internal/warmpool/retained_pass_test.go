// A RETAINED pool must complete a pass.
//
// It could not. Once held r.mu while building policy.Input, and one of that
// struct's fields was `r.awakeIntent(...)`, which takes r.mu itself to read the
// switch clock. sync.Mutex is not reentrant, so the pass deadlocked on its own
// lock and never returned -- and because nothing releases a mutex held by a
// blocked goroutine, the pool stopped reconciling for the life of the process.
// It held its GPUs and did nothing with them.
//
// Only retained pools were affected, which is exactly why nothing caught it:
// awakeIntent returns at its `!Retained` guard before reaching the lock, so
// every ordinary bridge pool takes the harmless path, and the switching rule's
// own tests call chooseAwake directly and never go through a pass at all.
//
// Measured on pokprod 2026-08-30: the warm pool logged for twenty seconds after
// startup and then went silent, with no error and no panic, every time
// warmPoolRetained was set.
//
// The timeout is the assertion. A deadlock does not fail, it hangs, so the test
// has to bound it itself -- `go test` would otherwise report a panic ten minutes
// later with no indication which pass was stuck.
