// WHOSE LOAD IS THE BRIDGE CARRYING, and is it one of the variant's own
// replicas?
//
// A warm pool Pod is owned by the POOL's workload, so the ownerReference walk
// that identifies every other Pod reaches the pool and not the model. While it
// is lent it is serving one variant's traffic, and that traffic has to be
// counted against that variant -- a bridge exists precisely because a variant is
// short, so its load is the load that most needs counting.
//
// Two things have to be right for that, and they pull in opposite directions:
//
//   - the bridge's metrics must be ATTRIBUTED to the variant, under the name
//     everything downstream keys a variant by, which is the ScaledObject's;
//   - the bridge must NOT be counted among the variant's own SERVING replicas,
//     because the pool reads that count to decide whether the ordinary replicas
//     have arrived and its Pod can go home.
//
// Both were wrong, in ways that only a cluster showed. The lending was published
// under the SCALE TARGET's name, which matched no analyzer row, so the bridge
// became a phantom variant of its own. Fixing that made the serving count reach
// the pool for the first time -- carrying the bridge inside it, so the pool was
// told the replicas had arrived one replica early.
//
// The fixtures below therefore give the variant and its scale target DIFFERENT
// names on purpose. Every unit test that missed this used one string for both.

		// BOTH halves, and the second is the one that is easy to miss. The pool's
		// shipped NetworkPolicy admits the controller and the model's namespace
		// and nothing else, deliberately -- so a PodMonitor on its own produces a
		// target that is refused at the network, which looks exactly like a Pod
		// that serves no metrics. Discovered by this spec failing with the engine
		// answering /metrics perfectly well to a tenant.
		// THE SHIPPED POLICY TOO, and it is not optional here.
		//
		// The comment above describes the shipped policy as though it were in
		// force. It was not: this spec never applied it, and the scrape rule
		// below was the ONLY policy selecting the pool Pods. NetworkPolicy is
		// additive-allow and a policy that selects a Pod denies everything it
		// does not admit, so the scrape rule -- :8000 from the monitoring
		// namespace, and nothing else -- locked the CONTROLLER out of :8001.
