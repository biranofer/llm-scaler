// DumpDemandEvidence prints what actually produced — or failed to produce — the
// demand a scale-from-zero spec is waiting on.
//
// Every scale-from-zero assertion depends on a chain the suite never showed:
// a trigger Job sends requests, the EPP queues them because the model has no
// ready endpoint, and WVA reads that queue. When the assertion fails, the
// controller log says only "no pending requests in flow control queue", which is
// WVA's view of the LAST link and is equally consistent with every earlier link
// having broken — the job never started, the requests were rejected outright
// instead of queueing, or they queued under labels nothing matches.
//
// A -v=4 capture of one failing run showed the cost of not distinguishing those:
// two models were polled continuously for five minutes each, 2652 and 2576
// samples, and the queue was never once non-empty, while models that passed found
// it occupied within a dozen samples. That rules out a sampling race — a request
// waiting in the queue would be seen at 10Hz — but it cannot say which earlier
// link failed, because none of them was recorded.
//
// So this dumps the trigger Job and its pods' own output. The script echoes an HTTP
// code per request, so it shows whether requests were sent at all, whether they
// were answered immediately or blocked, and what the gateway said. That is what
// identified the cause: ten instant 404s carrying vLLM's "the model does not
// exist", meaning the request was DISPATCHED to a pod serving something else
// rather than queued — so the queue WVA polls was never going to fill.
//
// The other half of that picture, who was serving in the pool, is asserted up
// front by requireEmptyServingPool rather than reported after the fact.
//
// Best-effort throughout: this runs on an already-failing path, so every step
// reports what it could not collect and continues.
